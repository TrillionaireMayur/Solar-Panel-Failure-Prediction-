# Problem statemnet :
The increasing reliance on solar energy has led to a significant increase in the
number of solar panels installed worldwide. However, the failure of these panels 
can result in decreased efficiency and increased costs for maintenance and repair. 
To mitigate this, a machine learning model is required to accurately predict the 
likelihood of solar panel failure before it occurs, allowing for proactive 
maintenance and reducing operational costs.The model must take into account various 
factors such as temperature, humidity, and panel age to provide accurate predictions. 
The goal is to develop a reliable and cost-effective solution for predicting solar
panel faults.
